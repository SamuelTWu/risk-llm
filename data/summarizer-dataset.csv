"{You awaken in a damp, dim stone chamber with a slightly open iron-bound wooden door and distant echoes. You open the door, revealing a narrow torch-lit hallway where whispers drift from deeper within. Pressing closer, you overhear two people arguing about a missing artifact and someone called ""The Warden,"" with urgency about recovering it before sunrise. Peering through a crack in the ceiling, you estimate it’s just past midnight, leaving only a few hours until dawn.}

The conversation halts instantly, and heavy footsteps rush toward your voice. A tall figure in a tattered cloak emerges, sword half-drawn but eyes wide with surprise. ""You're mad,"" he says, then smirks. ""But I like mad—I'm in.","You awaken in a damp, dim stone chamber. The air is heavy with moisture, and a faint light seeps through cracks in the walls. A slightly open iron-bound wooden door creaks in the silence. You push it open, revealing a narrow torch-lit hallway where whispers echo from somewhere deeper. Moving carefully toward the sound, you catch fragments of a tense conversation—two figures arguing about a missing artifact and someone called ""The Warden."" They speak urgently of recovering it before sunrise. Judging by the moonlight slanting through a crack above, it's just past midnight. Suddenly, the conversation halts. Heavy footsteps rush toward your voice. A tall figure in a tattered cloak emerges, sword half-drawn, eyes wide with surprise. ""You're mad,"" he says, then smirks. ""But I like mad—I'm in."""
"{After hours of weaving through tangled underbrush in search of the hidden temple, you stray from the overgrown path, chasing the sound of running water. The sun hangs low, painting the forest in amber. As you step over a mossy log, pain erupts in your ankle—a flash of scales vanishing into the leaves. A venomous snake. The bite burns hot, and already your leg feels heavy. Staggering back, you collapse beside the stream.}

A venomous snake has bitten you, and you can feel the poison spreading. You spot a medicinal plant nearby.","After hours of weaving through tangled underbrush in search of the hidden temple, you stray from the overgrown path, chasing the sound of running water.

Just as your vision begins to blur, you spot it—a cluster of broad-leafed plants with crimson veins, exactly like the one sketched in the old healer's journal. Your only hope lies within arm's reach."
"{The battle had raged since dawn—metal clashing, smoke thick in the air, cries of the fallen echoing across the valley. You fought through wave after wave, your armor battered, your blade chipped. The banner you swore to protect lies trampled in the mud, its colors barely visible. Blood—yours and others'—soaks your tunic, and every movement sends fire through your limbs. Collapsing to one knee, you gasp for breath as chaos churns around you. Then, a shadow looms. An enemy soldier steps forward, face unreadable beneath a cracked helm.}

You’re on the battlefield, wounds covering your body.
