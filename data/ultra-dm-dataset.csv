"{You awaken in a damp, dim stone chamber with a slightly open iron-bound wooden door and distant echoes. You open the door, revealing a narrow torch-lit hallway where whispers drift from deeper within. Pressing closer, you overhear two people arguing about a missing artifact and someone called ""The Warden,"" with urgency about recovering it before sunrise. Peering through a crack in the ceiling, you estimate it’s just past midnight, leaving only a few hours until dawn.}

Fall back!” but you’re already halfway through…"
"{You take a shallow breath and inch forward through the crawlspace, heart pounding. The clicking grows louder, echoing unnaturally as if amplified by the stone. Halfway through, the passage opens into a circular chamber shrouded in shadow. In the center, a pedestal stands—empty but for a faint shimmer above it, like heat rising from stone. Strange runes glow dimly along the walls, pulsing in rhythm with the clicking. Your companion crouches beside you, whispering, “Something’s guarding it…”}

It raises an incorporeal blade and assumes a defensive stance. Your companion steps back. “You woke it up…” he whispers. "

"{The cold wind howls through the abandoned town, rattling the windows and doors of the crumbling buildings. Snow falls in thick flakes, coating the streets in a blanket of white.

"{You find yourself standing in a dark, cramped alleyway in the heart of a bustling city. The sounds of footsteps and distant voices echo around you, but the alley itself is eerily quiet.

It steps aside, motioning for you to pass."
"{You wake up in the middle of a vast, open field, the grass tall and swaying in the gentle breeze. The sun hangs low in the sky, casting a golden hue over everything.
